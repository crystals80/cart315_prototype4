# CART 315 Exploration Prototype 4

<b>Design Hypothesis</b>  

<br>

////To Modify////By presenting to the player a simple instruction without much guidance to build a path, I believe that they can collect all the floating coins. So if I provide them the option to generate an unlimited amount of blocks, then the player will be able to create a path to go collect the coins. With the creative freedom the player will be given to build their path, will the user try to pick up all the coins or will they give up on the coins that are higher up?
